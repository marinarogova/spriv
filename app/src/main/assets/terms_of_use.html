we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.&nbsp;The arbitration may be
conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.
The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a
statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must
follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails
to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or
applicable law, the arbitration will take place&nbsp;in&nbsp;Kent

Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending
arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award
